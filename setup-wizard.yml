    title: Log Retention Time
    description: >-
      Define how much time the logs/data of your applications will be stored. By default, this time is set up to 15 days. 
      Take care of using a big number because the logs can occupy so much disk space. The unit measure is days. So if you define 30, the retention time will be 30 days.
